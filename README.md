## This is My Protfolio App

Here I build my protfolio using Frameworks like React and tailwindcss. I am basically Full Stack Developer.
So, Let me proceed!

First of all you need to write this in terminal for creating your react folder,
npm create vite

And then we need to install router-scroll for basic scrolling,
npm install react-scroll
